# Objective: Learn Python and coding!
## Motiation and Background
I recently had an interview where among other things, I could not code in Python in the time given. Over the years, my coding journey began with C++. Then Perl was the big thing for Biology, and later in 2016 I began my R journey with a little Python. Now, I believe for the next part of my Data Science journey, Python is mainstage.

Here, I will be coding some basic algorithms, and go onto leetcode questions for practicing Python.

I love the quote from - "Impractical Python Projects" by Lee Vaughan. - "You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing after they have tried everything else" - Weakly linked to Winston Churchill. 

So now after using data science methods for years, I will practice algorithms and learn to code fluently in Python!!

I have ideas to present this code, but for now it lies in the src folder.

## [For best practices in Python see](Best_Practices_Python.md)
- shbang  = #!/usr/bin/env python
- List comprehension
- Conventions
- `__main__` and `__init__`


## [The mighty sorting algorithms](SortingAlgorithms.md)
- Brute Force (MonkeySort, [SelectionSort](src/SelectionSort.py), [BubbleSort](src/BubbleSort.py))
- Stepwise decrease ([InsertionSort](src/InsertSort.py))
- Stepwise divide ([MergeSort](src/MergeSort_Pythony.py), [alt MergeSort](src/MergeSort.py), [QuickSort](src/QuickSort.py))
- Transform (TreeSort, HeapSort)
- Linear-time Sorting (RadixSort, CountingSort & BucketSort)

## Recursion
